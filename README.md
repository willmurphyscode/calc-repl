# What this repo is

This repo began life as a simple, lisp-like calculator REPL to help me learn
Rust, and, more specifically, learn [nom](https://crates.io/crates/nom).

After a bit of working on it, I decided it was enough fun to try making it into
a fully functional Scheme interpreter. 

Also, a word of warning: I don't have
a computer science degree, and this is a hobby project, so you may not want
to use it as your reference implementation for something critical.

# Contributing

This is a project I'm working on so that I can learn about Rust and programming
language design. If you're interested in helping out, I would really appreciate
pieces of feedback (or pull requests) in two areas:

1. Idiomatic Rust - I'm relatively new to  rust. If my match statements look cooky or something, please let me know.
2. Computer science learning - Is my shift-reduce parser completely bonkers? Do pieces of this project have the wrong name? Please let me know.
